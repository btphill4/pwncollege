Recall division in x86 is more special than in normal math. Math in here is
called integer math. This means everything, as it is now, is in the realm
of whole looking numbers. As an example:
10 / 3 = 3 in integer math. Why? Because 3.33 gets rounded down to an integer.
The relevant instructions for this level are:
mov rax, reg1; div reg2
Notice: to use this instruction you need to first load rax with the desired register
you intended to be the divided. Then run div reg2, where reg2 is the divisor. This
results in:
rax = rdi / rsi; rdx = remainder
The quotient is placed in rax, the remainder is placed in rdx.
Please compute the following:
speed = distance / time, where:
distance = rdi
time = rsi
Place the value of speed into rax given the above.
We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
rdi = 0xf0c
rsi = 0x39

To interact with any level you will send raw bytes over stdin to this program.
To efficiently solve these problems, first run it once to see what you need
then craft, assemble, and pipe your bytes to this program.

In this level you will be working with registers. You will be asked to modify
or read from registers_use.

We will now set some values in memory dynamically before each run. On each run
the values will change. This means you will need to do some type of formulaic
operation with registers_use. We will tell you which registers_use are set beforehand
and where you should put the result. In most cases, its rax.

Modulo in assembly is another interesting concept! x86 allows you to get the
remainder after doing a division on something. For instance:
10 / 3  ->  remainder = 1
You can get the remainder of a division using the instructions introduced earlier
through the div instruction.
In most programming languages we refer to mod with the symbol '%'.

Please compute the following:
rdi % rsi
Place the value in rax.

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
rdi = 0x21e25dad
rsi = 0x3ff

Please give me your assembly in bytes (up to 0x1000 bytes):
